# lungClassifier

I created this lung classifer for my undergrad machine learning class at University of San Francisco, CS 486.
Machine learning is an incredible field in computer science.
I wanted to create a lung classifier since I believe that machine learning could be useful in the medicine field. 
Especially during a time like right now. Coronavirus attacks the lungs of the victims.
This project could be used for other image classifications 
I got the dataset for the example model from kaggle.com.

## How to use
I used a CNN to create a model for the images process the images.
CNNs are the best ways to evaluate images.

./splitData -> ./trainData -> ./testData

## Machine learning
Incredible field that has in my opinion to great potential for improving life in the future.
If I have time, I would like to try to recreate the Pizza App from the show Silicon Valley. 
Unfortunately I don't have experience in app development to fully develop this.
But it doesn't seen too complicated after learning.
